## Overview

‚ö° This challenge was to build a responsive 3 column preview card component.

üöÄ I built this using HTML and CSS, with the help of [Figma](https://www.figma.com) for studying the design.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Figma

### Useful resources
- [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me add the [sr-only](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/screen-readers#screen-reader-only-elements) class style for the hidden header with the h1 title, so that it can still be accessed by screen readers.
